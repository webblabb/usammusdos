USAMM-Shiny allows users to explore an interactive map of predicted U.S. cattle and swine shipments based on USAMM.  Users choose either a county or state of interest and can explore incoming or outgoing shipments.  A downloadable summary table provides summarized predictions of the mean number of shipments and range between the focal county/state and those that it ships to or from.  Developed using the Shiny package app in R.
