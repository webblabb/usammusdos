summary: Our overall goal is to provide strong, data-driven predictions of U.S. livestock shipments and simulations of livestock disease and to characterize uncertainty in these predictions in order to support decision-making in both response and planning contexts.

# Objectives

The U.S. Animal Movement Model (USAMM) and Disease Outbreak Simulation (USDOS) were developed through an international collaboration with funding from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security.

The United States does not track individual livestock movements, therefore there is a need to characterize livestock shipments at the national scale in the U.S. USAMM provides estimates of the number of cattle or swine shipments between any two counties in the contiguous United States and includes estimates of uncertainty in the predictions.  USDOS is a national scale, premises-level simulation model that uses original algorithms to produce outputs very quickly even at large spatial scales. USDOS incorporates both local and long-range transmission together with multiple response options. USDOS has relatively few parameters so that sensitivity of model outputs to changes in parameters can be fully investigated. The model can run using demographic information from any country together with appropriate shipping data and/or local spread transmission. Inquiries about current work on this project may be directed to Lindsay Beck-Johnson at L.Beck-Johnson@colostate.edu

This web site is planned for use by both management and field personnel and disease modelers. This web site contains high-level descriptions of project deliverables, visualization tools, downloadable model predictions that can be ported into users own tools/systems, supporting publications with technical details, freely available downloadable code and user-guides. 


# Philosophy

Our overall modeling philosophy has three main components:

1. Strongly data-based modeling: Increases the relevance of the models to applied questions
2. Close working relationship with state and government agencies: Informs model structures and capabilities to handle realistic scenarios
3. Parsimonious modeling choices whenever possible: Enhances validation and sensitivity analysis by using fewer, better-informed parameters, optimizes tradeoffs among applied needs, available data and modeling techniques.

                                The parameter fitting process of USAMM is computationally intensive and requires up to weeks of run time on modern 32-core preocessors.  However, network realizations from the fitted USAMM model can be generated within seconds on a laptop.  The run times for USDOS vary depending on the size of the outbreak, but most simulations at the national scale finish in seconds even on a laptop.  Longer USDOS simulations are on the order of minutes at the national scale.

                                There are multiple reasons. For one, the underlying shipment data that we used to estimate USAMM parameters are confidential to protect personally identifiable information and are not freely available.  Aside from this, additional shipment data, apart from what the model has already been fitted to, are not currently available, and without additional data, the estimated parameters will not change. Hence, there really is no reason to re-estimate USAMM parameters.  Lastly, the parameter fitting process of USAMM is very computationally intensive and requires access to a modern high-performance computer cluster to give meaningful results.

                                Bugs may be reported to Lindsay Beck-Johnson at L.Beck-Johnson@colostate.edu.  We will maintain a list of known bugs.  We have tested the code extensively, but bugs can still appear.  However, bugs that are discovered after the end of funding for the project are unlikely to be addressed.
