summary: Our overall goal is to provide strong, data-driven predictions of U.S. livestock shipments and simulations of livestock disease and to characterize uncertainty in these predictions in order to support decision-making in both response and planning contexts.

# Objectives

The U.S. Animal Movement Model (USAMM) and Disease Outbreak Simulation (USDOS) were developed through an international collaboration with funding from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security.

Because the United States does not track individual livestock movements, there is a need to characterize livestock shipments at the national scale in the U.S. USAMM provides estimates of the number of cattle shipments between any two counties in the contiguous United States and includes estimates of uncertainty in the predictions. Current work will enhance USAMM predictions to include the size of cattle shipments and additional information on the types and sizes of premises involved in shipping.
USDOS is a national scale, premises-level simulation model that uses original algorithms to produce outputs very quickly even at large spatial scales. USDOS incorporates both local and long range transmission together with multiple control options. USDOS has relatively few parameters so that sensitivity of model outputs to changes in parameters can be fully investigated. The model can run using demographic information from any country together with appropriate shipping data and/or local spread transmission. Current work will incorporate a within-herd component to USDOS and allow investigation of slower-spreading disease outbreaks.

This web site is planned for use by both management and field personnel and disease modelers. This web site contains high-level descriptions of project deliverables, visualization tools, downloadable model predictions that can be ported into users own tools/systems, supporting publications with technical details, freely available downloadable code and user-guides.



# Philosophy

Our overall modeling philosophy has three main components:

1. Strongly data-based modeling: Increases the relevance of the models to applied questions
2. Close working relationship with state and government agencies: Informs model structures and capabilities to handle realistic scenarios
3. Parsimonious modeling choices whenever possible: Enhances validation and sensitivity analysis by using fewer, better-informed parameters, optimizes tradeoffs among applied needs, available data and modeling techniques.

# Directions

USAMM - Current work will enhance USAMM predictions to include the size of cattle shipments and additional information on the types and sizes of premises involved in shipping.  We are simultaneously developing USAMM-Swine to predict swine shipments at the U.S. national scale from Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection.  We are also working to transition USAMM to USDA for their direct use.  Future directions will include also developing USAMM-Swine that incorporates swine shipments from commuter agreement data.

USDOS - Current work will incorporate a within-herd component to USDOS and allow investigation of slower-spreading disease outbreaks.  We are also working to transition USDOS to USDA for their direct use.  Future directions will include USDOS work that incorporates swine diseases once USAMM-Swine is completed.

                                USAMM is available as C++ code.  Network realizations of USAMM can be produced as an option within our USDOS R UNIX package.  USDOS is also available as C++ code or within our USDOS R package.  Preprocessing and postprocessing pipeline code for running many USDOS realizations in batch mode is also available as R code.

                                USAMM code is computationally intensive.  However, network realizations from the fitted USAMM model can be generated within seconds on a laptop.  The run times for USDOS vary depending on the size of the outbreak, but most simulations at the national scale finish in seconds even on a laptop.  Longer USDOS simulations are on the order of minutes at the national scale.

                                USAMM code runs in parallel on a high performance computing system.  Network realizations of USAMM can be generated on a laptop.  USDOS runs on a laptop for single or a few realizations or on a high performance computing system for many realizations.

                                The USDOS R package for USAMM network generation or USDOS simulations currently runs in a UNIX computing environment.  C++ code is available for both USAMM and USDOS, which which can be compiled for and we have tested in multiple computing environments.

                                USAMM code is freely available to run on appropriately formatted shipment data.  However, the underlying ICVI data that we used to estimate USAMM parameters are confidential to protect personally identifiable information and are not freely available.  Aside from this, additional ICVI data are not currently available as we had to hand enter 20,000 records to generate the 2009 ICVI sample that was used to parameterize USAMM.  Without additional data, the estimated parameters will not change, hence there really is not a reason to re-estimate USAMM parameters.  However, it is straightforward to generate as many new realizations of USAMM predicted networks as you would like using the USDOS R package or C++ code.

We have tested the code extensively, but bugs can still appear.  However, bugs that are discovered after the end of funding for the project are unlikely to be addressed.
