# Overview of USDOS structure

This [presentation](literature/Schematics.pptx) provides a summary of how USDOS simulates disease spread, including an overview of the gridding procedure used to decrease the computational burden.

The method by which shipments are generated is further described [here](literature/Shipping_kernel_equations.pdf)

# Flow charts of code components

The overall structure of the USDOS code is described by this [flow chart](literature/main.pdf).

The structure of the code governing shipments is described by this [flow chart](literature/shipping_method_multinomial.pdf).
