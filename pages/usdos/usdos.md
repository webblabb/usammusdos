# Disease Outbreak Simulation

The model can be run to output single outbreaks or the summary statistics of many outbreaks in batch formulation.  USDOSv2 runs on a laptop or supercomputer. Run times even on a laptop for a single outbreak are on the order of seconds to a few minutes (minutes for continental scale outbreaks). USDOSv2 is available as a C++ executable or in an R package.

USDOSv2 can most easily be used through the USDOSv2 R package.
